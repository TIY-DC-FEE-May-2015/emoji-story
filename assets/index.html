		<p>Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not  appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in  which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she  said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and  perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad&mdash;at least not so mad as  it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat  again, sitting on a branch of a tree.</p>
		<p>'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p>

		She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'
